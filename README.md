# Recursion
## Theory:
Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.<br>
To prevent infinite recursion, if...else statement (or similar approach) can be used where one branch makes the recursive call and the other doesn't.<br>
### Advantages of C++ Recursion:
<ul>
  <li>It makes our code shorter and cleaner. </li>
  <li>Recursion is required in problems concerning data structures and advanced algorithms, such as Graph and Tree Traversal. </li>
</ul> 
Disadvantages of C++ Recursion:
<ul>
  <li>It takes a lot of stack space compared to an iterative program. </li>
  <li>It uses more processor time.</li>
  <li>It can be more difficult to debug compared to an equivalent iterative program.</li>
</ul>
